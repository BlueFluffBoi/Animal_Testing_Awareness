                <p>To evaluate the <strong>risks of a single new chemical, pesticide, or pharmaceutical product</strong>, 
                    government laws frequently call for a variety of <strong>different animal poisoning studies</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Thousands of animals are used in some tests</strong>, while others are <strong>performed twice or even three times using different 
                    animal species or delivery methods</strong> (forced oral feeding, forced inhalation, or cutaneous application); no analgesics are given.</p>
                <p>There are contemporary non-animal options that function equally as well—or better—than chemically poisoning animals or infecting 
                    them with lethal diseases like rabies to assess the efficacy of a vaccine.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Unexpectedly, a wide variety of animal species, <strong>particularly wild animals</strong>, are frequently employed in research.
                <br><br>
                By European law governing animal experiments, only <strong>vertebrate animals</strong> (mammals, birds, fish, and amphibians) and some invertebrates, such octopuses, are considered "animals." 
                Surprisingly, under US laws governing <strong>animal experiments, rats, mice, fish, amphibians, and birds are not considered to be animals. It follows that no legal consent is required to experiment on them</strong>, 
                and statistics do not include them.
                <br><br>
                Over a thousand facilities nationwide test on animals from dogs and cats to nonhuman primates. Laboratories are <strong>required to report federally-protected animals to the U.S. government</strong>; 
                this accounts for a relatively small percentage of the total estimated population.

                    Animals have no place in laboratories. They are usually <strong>sterile, enclosed spaces where the animals are kept in cages, pens, 
                        or Perspex boxes</strong> and are <strong>deprived of any freedom of movement and control over their own lives</strong>. In laboratories, some animals 
                    are segregated from other animals and kept in isolation.
